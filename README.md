# Who Killed George

![asd](img/game_logo.png)

A story driven game where you interrogate suspects and try to solve the mistery behind George's death.
The game was developed in the **GMTK Game Jam 2021**, an event where developers have 48 hours to create a game, this year's theme was "Joined Together".

I participated in the jam with the Last Minute Team ([@flaviocravero](https://soundcloud.com/flaviocravero) and [@portluc](https://www.deviantart.com/aewron)).

The game can be played on [itch.io](https://guspassos.itch.io/who-killed-george).
